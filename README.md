# PlayToMe
Script for iterating and merging adjacent .wav files. 

Works as is for files labelled as follows:
"prefix.count.wav"

Merging produces files with the name:
"prefix.countM.wav"
with the number of Ms being the number of merges done.

Labelling structure can be easily changed with the $prefix and $postfix variables
